  "description": "All changes included in 1.7:\n\n## Regression fixes\n\n- ([#11509](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11509)): Fix link-decoration regression in HTML formats.\n- ([#11532](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11532)): Fix regression for [#660](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/660), which causes files to have incorrect permissions when Quarto is installed in a location not writable by the current user.\n- ([#11549](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11549)): Fix regression in rendering `dashboard` tabsets into cards without titles.\n- ([#11580](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11580)): Fix regression with documents containing `categories` fields that are not strings.\n- ([#11752](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11752)): Fix regression with non-alphanumeric characters in `categories` preventing correct filtering of listing.\n\n## YAML validation\n\n- ([#11654](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11654)): Allow `page-inset` as value in `column` key for code cells.\n\n## Website projects\n\n- ([#11701](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11701)): Wrap HTML emitted by EJS templates in `{=html}` blocks to avoid memory blowup issues with Pandoc's parser.\n\n## Book projects\n\n- ([#11520](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11520)): Book's cover image now escapes lightbox treatment, which was incorrectly applied to it when `lightbox: true` was set in the book's configuration.\n\n## `quarto check`\n\n- ([#11608](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11608)): Do not issue error message when calling `quarto check info`.\n\n## `typst` Format\n\n- ([#11578](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11578)): Typst column layout widths use fractional `fr` units instead of percent `%` units for unitless and default widths in order to fill the enclosing block and not spill outside it.\n\n## Lua Filters and extensions\n\n- ([#11526](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/11526)):\n  General improvements to the style and robustness of Quarto's Lua code.\n  This also provides a new public function `quarto.utils.is_empty_node`\n  that allows to check whether a node is empty, i.e., whether it's an\n  empty list, has no child nodes, and contains no text.\n- ([#11699](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11699)): Fix crash with `video` shortcode inside HTML comments.\n- Expose new `quarto.paths.tinytex_bin_dir` in Quarto's Lua API. If TinyTeX is found by Quarto, this will be set to the path to the `bin` directory of the TinyTeX installation where command line tool are located (e.g., `pdflatex`, `tlmgr`, etc.). If TinyTeX is not found, this will be `nil`, meaning Quarto will use the system PATH to find the command line tools.\n- Fix `pandoc.mediabag` Lua typings so autocompletions work with the Lua LSP integration.\n\n## Other Fixes and Improvements\n\n- ([#8613](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/8613)): Fix `giscus` color on load to support dark mode (by @kv9898).\n- ([#11441](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11441)): Don't add newlines around shortcodes during processing.\n- ([#11643](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/11643)): Improve highlighting of nested code block inside markdown code block, i.e. using ` ```{{python}} ` or ` ```python ` inside ` ````markdown` fenced code block.\n"
