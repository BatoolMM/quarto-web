title: Placeholder Image and Lorem Ipsum Text Shortcodes
---

{{< include _pre-release-feature.qmd >}}

Quarto 1.5 introduces two new shortcodes that add flexibility and convenience to your content creation process:

1.  **Placeholder Image Shortcode** `{{{< placeholder >}}}`:  
    This shortcode generates a placeholder image, which is incredibly useful when you're designing your website layout but the final images aren't ready yet.
    It helps maintain the design integrity without interrupting the development flow.
    The shortcode can be customized with optional arguments to specify the width, height, and format of the placeholder image, like so:

    ::: {layout-ncol=1}
    ```markdown
    {{{< placeholder 400 200 format=svg >}}}
    ```

    {{< placeholder 400 200 format=svg >}}
    :::
    This will create a scalable vector graphic (SVG) placeholder image with dimensions of 400x200 pixels.

2.  **Lorem Ipsum Text Shortcode** `{{{< lipsum >}}}`:  
    When you need to visualize how text will look on your website, the `{{{< lipsum >}}}` shortcode comes in handy.
    It inserts "Lorem Ipsum" dummy text, which is standard placeholder text used in the publishing and design industries.
    You can even control the amount of text by specifying the number of paragraphs, for example:
    
    ::: {layout-ncol=1}
    ```markdown
    {{{< lipsum 1 >}}}
    ```
    :::: {.border}
    {{< lipsum 1 >}}
    ::::
    :::

    This will insert one paragraph of Lorem Ipsum text, allowing you to effectively plan the layout and typography of your content.

Both shortcodes serve as invaluable tools for web developers and content managers, streamlining the site-building process and ensuring that design does not stall due to missing content.
