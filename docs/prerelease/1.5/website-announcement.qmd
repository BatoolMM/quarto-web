Quarto's new **website announcement bar** feature is a versatile tool designed to enhance user engagement and communication on your website.
By adding a simple configuration to your `_quarto.yml` file, you can display a prominent, customizable announcement bar that grabs visitors' attention.
This feature allows you to set an icon, make it dismissable, and even include formatted content like bold text.
It's perfect for highlighting important information, such as alerts, promotions, or updates, directly to your audience.
The announcement bar can be positioned to fit seamlessly within your site's layout (*e.g.* `below-navbar` or `above-navbar`), ensuring the message is both impactful and integrated.

Here's an example of how you might configure it:

```yaml
website:
  announcement: 
    icon: info-circle
    dismissable: true
    content: "**Alert** - this is some information that you should pay attention to"
    type: primary
    position: below-navbar
```

- `icon` - The Bootstrap icon to display in the announcement bar. You can choose from any of the [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).
- `dismissable` - Whether the announcement bar can be dismissed by the user. It can be `true` or `false`.
- `type` - The type of the announcement bar. It can be one of `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `danger`, `warning`, `info`, `light`, `dark`.
- `position` - The position of the announcement bar. It can be one of `below-navbar` or `above-navbar`.
- `content` - The content of the announcement bar. You can use markdown to format the content.
