Quarto 1.6 includes the following new features:

- `{{{< contents >}}}` shortcode: Use this shortcode to flexibly rearrange the contents of your document, including moving the results of an executable code cell. See the [documentation for more](/docs/authoring/contents.qmd).

- [Landscape mode](/docs/authoring/article-layout.qmd#landscape-mode) blocks: Use fenced divs with class `.landscape` to set portions of `docx`, `pdf` and `typst` documents to landscape. Thanks to [`@edvinsyk`](https://github.com/edvinsyk)!
