title: Adding Placeholder Text to Your Documents

## Overview

You can include placeholder text ("lorem ipsum") in your Quarto documents by using the `lipsum` shortcode.

## Example

Here's an example of `lipsum` generating two paragraphs of text, by adding `{{{< lipsum 2 >}}}` in a paragraph by itself.

{{< lipsum 2 >}}

## Usage

`lipsum` takes a single parameter, in two possible formats:

- `{{{< lipsum nparas >}}}`: `nparas` describes the number of paragraphs of placeholder text to include in the document. 
- `{{{< lipsum start-end >}}}`: `start` and `end` are two numbers that describe the range of which lorem ipsum paragraphs to include in the document.
